# High-level design goals

This is the amended copy of the Simutrans-Extended high-level design goals that governs pakset
work. The goals were developed together with Pak128.Britain-Ex and were posted on the Simutrans
forum in January 2017: https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,16609.0.html
[FORUM:https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,16609.0.html]. The engine-side goals are
reproduced first; the pakset-specific amendments follow. Read this before any design or
balancing work.

## Goals

- What counts as a good decision in the game should be as close as possible to what would count
  as a good decision in an analogous real-life situation so that players can make their decisions
  imagining themselves to be in that real-life situation, rather than having to understand the
  game mechanics in detail and make a decision on the basis of those mechanics. In so far as
  reasonably possible, players should need to know only what aspects of reality are and are not
  simulated and how to work the user interface.
- By players playing with a realistic, game-oriented goal (e.g. to maximise profits), realistic
  transport networks and situations should arise.
- Within the confines of what is simulated (i.e. excluding matters such as boardroom politics,
  staff relations, political matters, etc. which no attempt is made to simulate), the level of
  challenge in achieving economic success by any means in the game should be roughly equivalent
  to the level of challenge of achieving that success by the same means in real life given the
  same starting conditions.
- In most cases, and consistent with real transport history, players should not have to run a
  maximally efficient operation in order to remain solvent. However, the degree of efficiency
  required to remain solvent should realistically vary with era and sector (e.g., a much higher
  degree of efficiency should be required to remain solvent in 21st century aviation than in
  19th century railway transport). Lower efficiency should, however, result in sufficiently
  reduced profitability such as significantly to slow a player's expansion compared with higher
  efficiency.
- The game should balance well and perform acceptably on very large maps (e.g. at least the size
  of England at 125 meters per tile, at equivalent population density), including in networked
  multi-player mode.
- There should be long-term network multi-player games on very large maps, which would have a
  realistic transport history as a result of realistic emergent play by the various players
  involved pursuing in-game goal oriented strategies with varying degrees of success.
- The in-game assets should make the game evocative of time and place, dependent on the current
  era and setting of the relevant pakset. (This is in large part a pakset design goal: there is
  no intention to impose this on pakset authors who have different goals, e.g. comic paksets, but
  rather to enable this).
- There should be a realistic degree of permanence to infrastructure and player assets such as
  vehicles: players should have to think carefully before investing in any given vehicle or
  transport route, as it should take a realistically long amount of time to amortise its cost.
  Players should have a strong incentive not to treat assets as disposable, but manage them
  efficiently, and doing so should be made easier by in-game tools (such as the tool to choose
  with which way to replace a way automatically when it has worn out).
- The in-game history should be apparent from the physical and economic features of the in-game
  present (together with information presented to the player, e.g. about the year in which a way
  was first created and last renewed) in a realistic and interesting way.
- Everything that has a cost or otherwise interacts with the economic system in the game should
  have a realistic economic function. In general, there should not be things that cost money that
  have only a cosmetic function or no function at all, nor a choice between different assets
  where that choice is usually economically significant in the game (e.g. between different
  vehicles) that in some cases is only of cosmetic importance. (Headquarters, as in Standard, is
  currently an exception to this rule; consideration will have to be given in the long-term as to
  what to do with this feature in the light of this).
- In multi-player games, there should be a mix of co-operative and competitive play styles
  naturally emerging by players individually pursuing in-game goals such as profit maximisation.
- Aside from a prohibition of malicious gameplay, harassment and other "trolling", there should
  need to be as few rules as possible in multi-player games restricting what players may do
  beyond the restrictions built into the code of the game itself in order for realistic and
  satisfying gameplay to emerge.
- In large multi-player games, players ought to be able to choose how much time that they have to
  invest in their networks by choosing how large to make their networks: smaller networks (e.g.
  light railways, or specialised local road transport networks, etc.) should need less in-game
  time to maintain successfully than larger networks (e.g. a trans-national railway network with
  a full set of suburban services, connecting 'bus routes, etc.). The game should allow players
  in large multi-player games to play in bursts, leaving their transport networks unattended for
  periods without being in danger of serious problems. Automated tools should assist this process
  where possible.
- Players who are able/willing only to invest enough time into a small network in a large
  multi-player game should nonetheless be able to enjoy and take advantage of great economic
  gameplay depth exploited more fully by players with larger networks.
- Players should never, or almost never, be in a situation where they have so much money that
  they cease to be under any meaningful financial constraint. The only way of removing financial
  constraint should be the freeplay mode (in single-player games only).

## Pakset-specific amendments

[UNVERIFIED] The following amendments are agent-drafted and await user review.

- The pakset supplies the data and images through which the engine realises the goals above. A
  goal is met for the pakset only when both the engine mechanism and the corresponding pakset
  data exist; an engine feature without pakset data is incomplete from the pakset's viewpoint.
- The goal that assets be evocative of time and place is primarily a pakset obligation: intro and
  retire dates, liveries, and object names should reflect real British history by era and region.
- Every pakset object that interacts with the economy must carry realistic costs, capacities,
  weights, speeds and dates so that the engine's economic simulation produces realistic
  decisions; purely cosmetic objects that nevertheless cost money are contrary to the goals.
- Historical realism in the pakset is bounded by what the engine can represent; where the two
  conflict, record the conflict rather than distorting either.

## Open questions

- Confirm, correct or extend the pakset-specific amendments above.

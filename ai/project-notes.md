# Project notes

**Covers**: short cross-cutting notes that are easy to miss and apply to many tasks. Read at the
start of most tasks.

## Notes

- The base workspace root is not a git repository. Only `New/` and
  `Git Blends/Pak128.Britain-blends/` are in-scope repositories; do not interact with any other
  repository even where a `.git` directory exists. `[CODE base filesystem, 2026-09-19]`
- `.dat` files are text but may be reported as binary by some readers; read them as text.
  `[CODE New master @ e36ec2321]`
- Pakset `.dat` values are consumed by Simutrans-Extended. Changing capacities, constraints,
  prices or other save-relevant fields can affect existing savegames and network games; see
  [pakset-compatibility](pakset-compatibility.md) before doing so.
- The pakset has two halves kept in two repositories: the compiled sources in `New/` and the
  Blender meta-sources in `Git Blends/Pak128.Britain-blends/`. A graphics change normally starts
  in the latter and ends as `.png` files in the former.

## Planned sections

- Further cross-cutting facts as they are discovered.

## Open questions

- Are there other recurring facts that deserve to be here rather than in a domain doc?
